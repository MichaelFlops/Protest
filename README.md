Protest
=======

Protest organizing application created originally for a hackathon at UC Santa Cruz. Allows protestors to communicate and coordinate with each other anonymously, without having to fight to be heard. It works peer to peer so even if police (or an oppressive regime) were to shut down cell phone towers (as they did here: http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/post/bart-san-francisco-cut-cell-services-to-avert-protest/2011/08/12/gIQAfLCgBJ_blog.html) protestors will still be able to send and recieve messages.

Based on this paper: (http://ecee.colorado.edu/~ekeller/classes/fall2013_advsec/papers/tarzan_ccs02.pdf) 
Protocol is designed so that the identity of the sender of any message can be kept anonymous.
